[Fuchsia] is an open-source project that aims to create a production-grade operating system. The operating system aims to assist developers in building across multiple device platforms.
The core architectural principles guiding Fuchsiaâ€™s design and development are

**SECURE**

All software that runs on Fuchsia is granted the fewest privileges necessary to do its job and has access to only the information it requires.

**Updatable**

Software on Fuchsia, like the web, is designed to come and go as needed, and security patches can be pushed to all products on demand.

**Inclusive**

C++, Web, Rust, Go, Flutter, and Dart are among the languages and runtimes supported.

**Pragmatic**

It is a production-level operating system that must adhere to fundamentals such as performance.
